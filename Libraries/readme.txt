
ARDUINO LIBRARIES
------------------

These are libraries that are used by the various OpenBCI Arduino sketches.


** ADS1299: This is the core library for servicing the OpenBCI shield (V1 and V2).  It contains the base ADS1299 Class as well as the ADS1299Manager class.  This library was developed and tested using Arduino 1.0.5.

** Biquad: This is a library used in some sketches to perform time-domain filtering of the EEG data on the Arduino itself.  This library was last developed and tested in Arduino 1.0.5.  This code is a slightly modified version of the code originally found at http://www.earlevel.com/main/2012/11/25/biquad-c-source-code/ 



Instructions
------------

Download these libraries, unzip them, and put the contents into your Arduino "libraries" directory.  On a Windows PC, I liked to put them in "My Documents\Arduino\Libraries\".
